# Inn.ts Framework

Inn.ts is a simple framework for building apps in React using Vite. Compared to other frameworks such as Next.js, we focus on interactivity, performance, portability, and TypeScript support. Inn.ts apps build into an Single Page Application (SPA) making it easy to deploy them to any hosting platform, like Innatical Cloud or Cloudflare Pages.
